================================================================================

WHAT IS CAMPUSCORE 2.0?
-----------------------
CampusCore 2.0 is a complete digital solution for managing all school
operations in one place. It's like having a digital office that handles
everything from student registration to report card distribution.


THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED
----------------------
Traditional schools face these challenges:

1. Paper-Based Records
   - Student records stored in physical files
   - Hard to search and update
   - Risk of loss or damage

2. Multiple Systems
   - Separate systems for attendance, marks, reports
   - No communication between systems
   - Teachers waste time switching between tools

3. Limited Communication
   - Parents can't easily check child's progress
   - Teachers manually inform parents about updates
   - Delayed information sharing

4. Manual Processes
   - Report cards created manually (time-consuming)
   - Attendance marked on paper
   - Marks calculated by hand

5. No Real-Time Updates
   - Information not available instantly
   - Parents visit school for updates
   - Teachers can't access data from home

Step 1: Vice Principal logs into the system

Step 2: Goes to "Register Users" section

Step 3: Fills student registration form:
        - Student ID: 3240510
        - Name: John Doe
        - Class: 10A
        - Date of Birth: 15-05-2008

Step 4: Clicks "Register Student"

Step 5: System automatically creates:
        - Student record
        - Parent account
        - Login credentials for both
        - Links parent to student

Step 6: System shows success message with login details

Step 7: From next day, teacher marks attendance daily:
        - Selects date
        - Selects class 10A
        - Marks John Doe as Present or Absent
        - Saves attendance

Step 8: After exams, teacher enters marks:
        - Selects John Doe
        - Enters exam name: Midterm Examination
        - Enters subject: Mathematics
        - Enters marks: 85 out of 100
        - Checks "Auto-publish to Parents"
        - System calculates: 85% = Grade A
        - Saves marks

Step 9: Teacher repeats for all subjects:
        - Science: 92/100 (A+)
        - English: 78/100 (B)
        - Social Studies: 88/100 (A)

         - Selects Exam: Midterm
         - Clicks "Generate Report Cards"
         - System automatically:
           * Groups all John's marks
           * Calculates overall: 85.75%
           * Assigns overall grade: A
           * Creates report card

Step 11: Coordinator sends report card to parent

Step 12: Parent logs in and sees:
         - John's attendance: 95% (19 present, 1 absent)
         - Exam results: All subjects with grades
         - Report card with overall A grade
         - Option to download report card

Step 12: Confirmation message appears: "Mark this duty as completed?"

Step 13: Teacher confirms

Step 14: System updates duty status to "Completed" with completion date

Step 15: Duty moves from "Pending" section to "Completed" section

Step 16: Vice Principal can see duty was completed on their end


EXAMPLE 3: DAILY ATTENDANCE SCENARIO
